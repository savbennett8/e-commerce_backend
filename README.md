## Description
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

Check out my [video demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oZpA0_rP55S_GWdC9SHGOWUqwi0uNWaz/view) of how this application works.

### Installation
This application uses [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html), [MySQL 2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv), and [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/). Click the associated links to find out how to download and use them. I also use Insomnia Core in my video demo to test api points. 

### Usage
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
